                    Hello! I'm Karla Zuniga, and I'm delighted to be your TA for course 4111. 
                    In Spring '23, I had the privilege of taking this course with Professor Ferguson, 
                    an experience that profoundly impacted me thanks to its real-world applications in computer science.
                <p>
                    Prior to this role, I've been a Teaching Assistant for both Data Structures and Introduction to Java. Additionally, I had the privilege of contributing in CS as a researcher during my internship at Harvard University’s engineering department. Outside of the academic world, I cherish spending quality time with my family, diving into a good book, and going for runs. I'm truly passionate about this course, and I look forward to guiding you through an exciting semester of learning at Columbia!
